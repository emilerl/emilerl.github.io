Yesterday I had my [lunch](http://www.subway.com/applications/menu/images/400_x/meatball-01.jpg)in front of the computer at the office and since I’m easily bored by just sitting and eating by myself, I fired up Safari and browsed to TED.com for a little meal entertainment. While enjoying my Marinara Meatball sub I watched Yochai Benkler’s seminar [Open-source economics](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/247), which was really interesting. He draws similar conclusions as Tor Nørretranders in his book [The Generous Man](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560257288/qid=1149782680/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-0163772-4243843?s=books&v=glance&n=283155/) – that we are moving towards a sharing community and how the mechanics of open source project organization (i.e. a lot of people sharing for a greater good) is widely used by large organizations such as NASA. Very interesting video indeed.
