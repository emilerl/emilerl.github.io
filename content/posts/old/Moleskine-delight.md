On a business trip to Stockholm today I had some time to kill and went to the pen and paper section of the department store [Ã…hlens](http://www.ahlens.se/) to search for a new notebook (I admit, I have a notebook addiction). Naturally I first checked the [Moleskine](http://www.moleskine.com/)Â shelf as they produce the mostÂ convenientÂ and good looking notebooks on the planet. To my surprise they had a new model with soft cover without the classic elastic rubber band. It was available in five different colors which is new to me .. have never seen anything but black Moleskines.Â 

Of course I bought one and when I got home the converter and Black/Blue ink for my [Lamy Al-Star](http://www.lamy.com/eng/b2c/AL-star/025)Â had arrived with the mailâ€¦ time for some serious writing action ðŸ˜‰
