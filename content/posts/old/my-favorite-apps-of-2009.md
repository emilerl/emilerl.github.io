The number of applications in Apple’s App Store has exploded during 2009 and it is getting harder and harder to find new stuff. Therefore I thought it was a good idea to share my favorite applications of 2009 (mostly based on the apps I have used the most).

[Reeder](http://reederapp.com/)  
As a [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/) addict I have tried several iPhone apps for accessing my feeds while on the road. First I used the mobile version of Google Reader, simply browsing to the site in Safari. It didn’t map to the way I use reader though and later I stumbled upon [Byline](http://www.phantomfish.com/byline.html) (native app) which was a step in the right direction. After that I started using [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWireiPhone/Default.aspx) which also improved the reading experience. It wasn’t until I found Reeder that I can say I’m happy with the reading experience on the iPhone. There are only a few features that I miss (such as reading items shared by others, or recommended items). One of the apps I use most days except Mail and Phone.   
  
[Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/iphone)   
Instapaper is a good complement to Google Reader and other news services allowing me to read some of the longer articles when I have the time. Besides my Sony Reader Touch (via Calibre), the iPhone app is the place were I read most of the content from Instapaper.com.

[Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/)  
My Twitter usage goes up and down, but when I’m in the mood, I use Tweetie on the iPhone.

[Boxcar](http://boxcar.io/)  
A good complement to Tweetie, allowing me to get notifications about direct messages or mentions.  
  
[Hipstamatic](http://hipstamaticapp.com/)  
Of all the camera apps I have tried, this is the only one I have kept. The various lenses and films you can buy in the application makes you want to experiment and try new things. For some examples, check [“Paper Stuff”](http://emilerl.posterous.com/paper-stuff) at my Posterous blog.  
  
[Ninjawords](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=316377359&mt=8) [iTunes direct link]  
The [controversy](http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/ninjawords) (via: Daring Fireball) around Ninjawords was actually the thing that got me to try it. As the web service ([ninjawords.com](http://ninjawords.com/)) it is a really fast way of looking up [Wiktionary](http://www.wiktionary.org/) words.

[Snatch](http://www.hoofien.com/Snatch/index.html)  
In the summer of 09 I bought a Mac Mini and installed Plex. I didn’t want a complete keyboad and mouse setup, so instead I researched remote control solutions allowing me to remote control the Mini via my iPhone and WiFi (or BlueTooth). Even though it is a bit unstable from time to time, it is still my favorite way of controlling the Mini from the phone. 

[The TripIt App](http://www.tripit.com/uhp/iphone)  
Since I travel quite a lot, the TripIt app have saved me many times during sprints at airport trying to find out when the connecting flight departs.  
  
[Soundcurtain](http://www.futureacoustic.com/soundcurtain/)  
While traveling it can be hard to find solitude and privacy to get some work done. Soundcurtain is a great cure, analyzing the environment sound volume via the mic and generates a sound to tune it out. I mostly use the rain mode.   
  
[Nike + iPod](http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/)  
Even though this is a built-in application I thought it was worth mentioning. If you have the Nike+ equipment it is a very nice way of keeping track of your exercise.   
  
[Top shelf](http://www.drinksapp.com/)  
Previously named “Drinks”, Top shelf is my first stop for finding drink recipes and inspiration.[](http://www.jamieoliver.com/20-minute-meals/)

[20 minute meals – Jamie Oliver](http://www.jamieoliver.com/20-minute-meals/)  
Another great stop for recipes. Nice inspiring photos and very clear instructions. I particularly like the shopping list feature. [](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=342699962&mt=8)

[Rat on a scooter XL](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=342699962&mt=8) [iTunes direct link]  
Most addictive game of 2009. I have a high score of 140 and it starts to get hard beating it. [](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307727765&mt=8)

[DoodleJump](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307727765&mt=8) [iTunes direct link]  
Second most addictive game of 2009. It does not have the same feeling of speed as Rat on a scooter, but it is still a good game. My highscore is 20.000-something.[](http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/sydsvenskan/id294010168?mt=8)

[Sydsvenskan](http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/sydsvenskan/id294010168?mt=8) [iTunes direct link]  
My local newspaper. The app feels solid and always brings me the latest news. One of the better news outlets in Sweden.[](http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/mobilblogg/id347854404?mt=8)

[MobilBlogg](http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/mobilblogg/id347854404?mt=8) [iTunes direct link]  
A friend and a colleague at [Purple Scout](http://purplescout.se/), [Tobias/tru](http://tobi.nu/) have created a very nice client for the Swedish micro blog [mobilblogg.nu](http://mobilblogg.nu/) (requires account). Even though I don’t use mobilblogg.nu that much, I thought it was worth mentioning since it is a very nice and solid application. It is released as [open source](http://opensource.purplescout.se/projects/show/mbiphone). [](http://stardefense.ngmoco.com/)

[StarDefence](http://stardefense.ngmoco.com/)  
Before this game I wasn’t that much into tower defense games, but it has all changed now. [](http://www.firemint.com/flightcontrol/)

[FlightControl](http://www.firemint.com/flightcontrol/)  
Addicive fun, especially to play against another player via BlueTooth.
