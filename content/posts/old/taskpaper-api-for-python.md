Just created a Python API for reading and modifying (even if all the modify features are not complete yet) TaskPaper files. The (so far very small) project is hosted at my GitHub page [here](http://github.com/emilerl/emilerl/tree/master). The file you are looking for if you want to play with the API can be found [here](http://github.com/emilerl/emilerl/blob/b08e8fa8b9d6b6eae0dbc6a51a81e97e72a65f1a/TaskPaper/taskpaper.py).
