[Uffe](http://pojo.se/) mentioned that TUAW ([_Evernote Mac 1.1 – The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)_](http://www.tuaw.com/2008/05/13/evernote-mac-1-1/)) is highlighting that version 1.1 of [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) was released recently. I have used Evernote for a couple of weeks now and so far I think it has great potential, but still needs a lot of polishing. 

If you are interested in testing this innovative note taking concept, leave a comment and I will send you an invite (have 14 left right now).
