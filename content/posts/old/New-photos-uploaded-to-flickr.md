During my vacation I have re-organized my digital photo collection. That includes starting to use digiKam to organize them, and flickr.com to show them.

My latest batch were taken during my first visit to the United States in February 2005. I was there to attend the yearly Eclipse conference [Eclipsecon](http://www.eclipsecon.org/).
