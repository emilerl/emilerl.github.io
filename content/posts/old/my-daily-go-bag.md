After re-organizing my messenger bag today I was inspired by Lifehacker article â€œShow us your go bagâ€œ, took a photo and documented everything inside. It helps me remember all the things I actually lug around each day so that when I need them I really use them. It have happened all to often that I have solved situations much to complicated just because I didnâ€™t use the tools at hand (or in my bag).

After I wrote this I realized that I forgot to include the actual bag in the picture â€¦ well if I have the energy when my new camera bag arrives, I will make an updated photo ðŸ™‚
