I have shaved with the straight razor for almost a week now and I must say that Iâ€™m pleased with the performance so far. It will take some time to get the same results that Iâ€™m used to with the safety razor, but it is kind of fun learning to master this lost form of art ðŸ™‚

I will keep the blog updated with more information as I progress. It is a material hobby, and I will try to review things as I use them (knifes, brushes, soaps, oils, after shaves etc). Stay tuned.
