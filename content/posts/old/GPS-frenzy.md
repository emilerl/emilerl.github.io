I'm going for a hike in [Abisko](http://www.abisko.nu/vinter07/englishpages/index.asp) late this summer. As a gadget freak I just had to purchase a new gadget for this adventure – a [Garmin eTrex Legend Cx](http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexLegendcx/). I have owned other GPS units before, but this one is so small, waterproof and straight forward to use (yeah I know it’s a sales pitch, but what the heck). What enticed me the most was not the possibility to see my position on a map at all times, but rather to have a very accurate trace of our hike afterwards.

I have not owned this gadget more than 24 hours, and I have already found several exiting GPS-related activities that I haven’t thought so much about before:

-   Track your every move and [look](http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/) at [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) later
-   [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/)
-   [Create personal GPS maps](http://www.mapwel.biz/)
-   Generate nice graphs and stats from track data and waypoints (read Python scripting)

Soon I will have completed a set of scripts for working with the GPX-files produced when tracking is enabled. After that, my goal is to create a small Python app for mapping a track to any raster image (for instance aerial photography, scanned map etc) and showing graphs and stats from the track suitable for publishing on the web.

## Geocaching

Pirates and treasure maps – [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/) is playing pirates for adults (without the cannons and looting). While searching for information on how to create custom Garmin GPS maps I stumbled over the concept of Geocacing. Well, I have heard about it before but never spent time understanding what it is.  
The short version can be described as:

1.  Person A takes some interesting items and puts them in a weather proof box (items + pen and a log)
2.  Person A finds a good place to hide the box anywhere in the world
3.  Person A marks the location with a GPS (lat/long) and registers the “cache” at [http://www.geocache.com](http://www.geocache.com/) (or some other site)
4.  Person B browses [http://www.geocache.org](http://www.geocache.org/) (or some other site) and finds the “cache” hidden by Person A
5.  Person B downloads the location info into a GPS unit and sets of for a hunt for the “cache”
6.  Person B finds the cache, replaces an item in the box and logs the visit
7.  Person B logs the cache finding at [http://www.geocache.com](http://www.geocache.com/) (or some other site)

I have already found some “cache-sites” around the area where I live and will hunt them down soon. I also plan to plant my own “cache” later so stick around, I will probably write some more about this new hobby of mine. [Arrr!](http://www.talklikeapirate.com/howto.html)
