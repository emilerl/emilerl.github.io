Published 2005 by Addison Wesley and written by Adam Barr, this piece of work comes right from the press. It challenges the reader to analyse the source a step further like a “human debugger”. Many bugs are hidden during normal debugging and does not show up in unit tests.

To find these bugs, the programmer must actively read and understand what the code does (especially if the code is written by someone else). What this book does for the reader is giving an understanding of how to execute the code in the mind and thus find those “hidden” bugs.

In 50 exercises written in 5 different programming languages you will learn how to debug code in your head. Adam’s long experience in the field at Microsoft is well represented throughout the entire book.
