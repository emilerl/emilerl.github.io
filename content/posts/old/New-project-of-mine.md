I have acquired the domain [buglix.se](http://buglix.se/) where I soon will start a new web project. For four years now I have written articles for different paper magazines and now I think it is time to share these articles online too. The articles will be in Swedish only, and I will publish them when I get time to it (which will be soon since I’m on vacation ).

## First article

I just now published my first article on [buglix.se](http://buglix.se/). It was first published in a Swedish computer magazine back in 2003 so I will probably update this online version a bit when I have the time.

I’m still tinkering with the UI of buglix.se so don’t be surprised if it looks completely different the next time you pay a visit.
