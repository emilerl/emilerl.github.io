Yesterday I attended Richard Stallman’s session titled “Free Software and Beyond: Human Rights in the Use of Software and Other Published Works” in Gothenborg. 

I expected it to be two hours of Microsoft bashing (and it was too), but it turned out to be quite interesting. Even though I don’t agree with Stallman and FSF on all points and their arguments are not always “water proof”, I think it is necessary to have organizations like FSF/GNU to act as a counter weight to organizations like Microsoft and others.
