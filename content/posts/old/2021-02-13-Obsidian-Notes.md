I've been trying [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) a little now and then ever since they first came out. I recently stumbled across Nick Milo's [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA) Youtube channel and it got me excited about the idea of utilizing linking better in my note taking. I've now started in Obsidian and I even created a publish site at [https://notes.buglix.org](https://notes.buglix.org) where I'll publish some things soon.
