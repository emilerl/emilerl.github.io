title: I'm on InterfaceLIFT!

After an [indoor macro shoot-out](http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilerl/sets/72157594489085394/) this weekend I decided to submit one of my more successful (at least to my liking) photos of a [yellow rubber duck against a deep blue background](http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilerl/363875988/in/set-72157594489085394/) to [InterfaceLIFT](http://www.interfacelift.com) (a popular place for things that prettifies ones desktop). In just 20 minutes I got the response that they liked my "Ducky" and even wanted more (my NES controller in purple).

I will now scan through my archive of photos for more desktop material and hope to have more photos featured at InterfaceLIFT.com.
