<p><em>If you are looking for a HOW TO on installation of Ubuntu, please scroll down a bit.</em></p>
<p>I recently bought a new laptop from Fujitsu-Siemens – the Amilo SI 1520. My requirements for this laptop was that it should be fairly cheap (max 1000 euros), run Linux with ease and feature a 12 inch wide screen.<br>
After browsing through some local (Swedish) internet stores I soon concluded that I had to go with the high end consumer segment instead of the business segment, otherwise my budget requirement would have gone through the roof. I narrowed the selection down to either the Lenovo 3000 V100 or the FSC Amilo SI 1520.
