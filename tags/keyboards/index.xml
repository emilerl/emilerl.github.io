With my two other keyboards, the Keychron Q1 and KBNordic Nordic60, I&amp;rsquo;ve built custom QMK firmware as I want some extra features that are not possible with VIA alone. Things like leader keys and having easily having keymaps and macros in sync across different keyboards. I also really like the Space Cadet feature, having the left and right shift keys act as left and right parenthesis if tapped and shift if held.</description></item></channel></rss>
