[![Dictionary pop up](http://erlandsson.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/autodict.png)](http://erlandsson.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/autodict.png)Found a nice post at Lifehacker today which lists [ten things you forgot that you mac can do](http://lifehacker.com/390226/top-10-things-you-forgot-your-mac-can-do), and to be frank, I didn't even know it could do this.

Highlight any word by selecting it, or simply hover the mouse pointer over it and press **Control + Command + D**, and a stylish pop-up will appear with a definition of the word from the built in dictionary. Very nifty.
