[{"content":"I recently decided I wanted to build my keyboard based on the KBDfans KBD67 Lite R3 ISO kit. With my two other keyboards, the Keychron Q1 and KBNordic Nordic60, I\u0026rsquo;ve built custom QMK firmware as I want some extra features that are not possible with VIA alone. Things like leader keys and having easily having keymaps and macros in sync across different keyboards. I also really like the Space Cadet feature, having the left and right shift keys act as left and right parenthesis if tapped and shift if held. Because I\u0026rsquo;m using an ISO layout, I have to re-map LSPO_KEYand RSPC_KEY to KC_8 and KC_9, otherwise, I get ) from the left shift and = from the right.\nAs the wired KBD67 has QMK support, I thought it would be a walk in the park to get my customizations compiled and flashed on my new board. It was not as easy as that though. I started by trying to compile the default keymap for kbdfans/kbd67/mkiirgb_iso, locally, in my fork of the QMK firmware. That resulted in a build error at the very end. The check-size at the end of the build process failed because the resulting firmware was too large: 24800/24576 (224 bytes over). I also tried to do the same with the QMK Configurator, just to ensure that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t something locally that screwed up the build and sure enough, it failed there too.\nI started to compare the mkiirgb_iso with the mkiirgb/v3 as I was thinking that the PCBs are probably similar. The defines a size for the boot loader in the rules.mk file: BOOTLOADER_SIZE = 6144. I assumed this could probably be related.\nAs this was from the main branch and since I\u0026rsquo;m not all that familiar with the inner workings of QMK, I decided to file an issue. I tagged the listed maintainer of the keyboard and waited a couple of days, but no response. As I wanted to get it working I asked in the QMK discord and I received the tip to look through the suggestions in the Squeezing AVR article.\nJust enabling the link-time optimization by setting LTO_ENABLE = yes in the rules.mk file helped me get it to a passing size.\nThe day after I saw that a solution for my issue was posted where some RGB animations were disabled and the BOOTLOADER_SIZE = 6144 was set in the rules.mk for the mkiirgb_iso. I built the firmware with these changes and flashed it. Initially, everything seemed to work as it should, but I realized after a while that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t soft reset the keyboard anymore by holding ESC while plugging in the USB cable. I had to use the physical reset button on the bottom of the PCB to be able to flash it again. I removed the boot loader size flags from rules.mk and re-compiled. After this, everything works as it should again.\n","permalink":"https://buglix.org/posts/qmk-and-kbd67-iso/","summary":"I recently decided I wanted to build my keyboard based on the KBDfans KBD67 Lite R3 ISO kit.

Reading tweets and articles on the topic it seems like Microsoft OneNote is the beacon of hope for many. It provides roughly the same feature set, it’s available on many devices and it is free to use.

At least if you want to take your data with you.\nFrom my perspective I think Evernote’s decision to change their pricing and usage terms is a great opportunity to re-evaluate your choice if you are a user of their service. There are hundreds of solutions available for note taking and there is no rush to jump ship as Evernote are not closing down. Take your time and think about what you need in a new solution, and when evaluating new services — make sure to check if you can easily move on later and take your data with you.

I really like the idea of fully fledged tools like Omnifocus, but after I get all my stuff in there I start to loose the overview perspective and after a few weeks I almost don\u0026rsquo;t want to open the app anymore.\nI have found a pattern in the tools that I use - the more low-tech they are, the longer I stay with them. It\u0026rsquo;s something special about the freedom of just jotting something down in a notebook or being able to move text around freely on the screen. Paper based notebooks have the disadvantage that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to search and index them and that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve eventually left them behind.

Or actually, re-started as I have tried it in the passed and dismissed it as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have all the bells and whistles of something like OmniFocus.\nIt is not only an app, but also a way to structure tasks, projects, tags and notes in plain text so it can be used with other plain text editors as well (more on that in a coming post). Hogbay\u0026rsquo;s website is not selling the concept very well, but there are two comprehensive articles by Gabe Weatherhead - Part 1 and Part 2.\nThe more I use it the more I like it.

It all started Saturday morning. I have been using the Drobo as a media backend for my Plex/Mac Mini HTPC setup. RipIthas helped me backup my DVD collection and I have carefully named each movie so that the IMDB scraper in Plex can find information about it. Before going to bed Friday night I started a copy job of the latest movies from my Ubuntu box to the Drobo (via DroboShare/Samba). Saturday morning I discovered that all the 7 copy jobs was stopped due to \u0026ldquo;Connection time out\u0026rdquo; with the Drobo. I tried copy files to it again, and once more I got a time out message. The Drobo Dashboard told me that everything was fine and that my data was secure, but I could not write anything to the disk. I connected the Drobo via USB directly to my MB Pro to analyze the problem thoroughly and it turned out OS X could only mount the Drobo in read-only mode. Disk Utility couldn\u0026rsquo;t verify or repair the disk so I researched the web and it seems like a common problem. None of the suggested solutions worked (not even DiskWarrior) to get the disk fixed, so I had to buy extra disk space for my Ubuntu box and copy everything back (roughly 1TB of music, movies and photos), reformat the Drobo and copy everything back again. So far I\u0026rsquo;m 12 hours into the first copy job so I guess I will be back on track sometime in the next two days.\nWhile researching for the read-only problem I discovered that there is a lot of horror stories about Drobos eating data and users with poor help from Data Robotics customer support. One of the biggest selling points of the Drobo is that it protects against (multiple) drive failures and keeps data safe, but who is going to protect me from malfunctioning closed-source file systems?\n","permalink":"https://buglix.org/posts/old/my-drobo-turned-on-me/","summary":"After I have been recommending Drobo to almost everyone I have talked to for roughly a month (bought it on recommendation from TWiT), it suddenly turned on me this weekend.

I have been a practicioner of David Allen’s GTD method on and off for almost three years now. I have tried all kinds of implementations of the method, both in software and in paper based solutions like the Moleskine. I started with a lot of lists in a big text file, then a Moleskine setup (see PigPogPDA and Hacking a GTD Moleskine) then an array of different software solutions like TiddlyWiki, MonkeyGTD, ThinkingRock GTD, Midnigt Inbox, Todo.sh/Todo.txt, iGTD, OmniFocus, Things, The Hit List, Nozbe, RememberTheMilk and a few others I can’t remember the name of. The latest solution I have stuck with for more than four months now is OmniFocus by the OmniGroup, a very nice piece of software.\nI have been a user of OmniFocus ever since the closed beta period even if I have tried other solutions now and then (it is in my nature to shake things up whenever I can). I have been driven to other solutions by the fact that, even as OmniFocus is a great app (and OmniGroup produces several other nice ones), it can be quite complex at times. During the collection and review phase it is way to easy to create all to many projects/contexts and organize them into levels of levels of hierarchies. Of course it is very good to get all that data out of ones head, that is the whole point of GTD, but it is very intimidating when you look at it all just to find a single task to do next, like you are about to build the pyramids or some similar achievment. This is of course my personal oppinon which is heavily colored by the fact that I cannot function in a completely organized environment, whether it is my desk at work, icons at my desktop, e-mails in my inbox or tasks in my todo manager.\nFor a while now I have been “off the GTD wagon” as many refer to not following the GTD guidelines David set up for us. When browsing through my feeds tonight a post at LifeHacker really got me thinking about why my current OmniFocus setup and why it isn’t working for me – Quickly Prioritize Your Tasks by Urgency and Importance by Adam Pash. Just having four priorities really seems like a good idea, UI – Urgent/Important, NUI – Not Urgent/Important, UNI Urgent/Not Important and NUNI – Not Urgent/Not Important. When I thought about how to implement that in OmniFocus with all the levels of organization it would bring I realized that I needed to start over again – todo ground zero. I remembered that I briefly tested a text based GTD app a couple of years ago and that I actually got a license for it together with the last MacHeist bundle. Enter Taskpaper!\nTaskpaper by Jesse Grosjean (HogBaySoftware)\nThe approach Taskpaper takes is to work with plain text based files, annotated (anotation described in Taskpaper User´s Manual) in a way readable both by machines and humans (thus giving the advantage of data beeing readable even when Taskpaper isn’t avaialble for some reason). It features shortcuts for most common actions such as assigning contexts/tags to tasks, marking tasks done and archiving them, adding to @today context and of course adding new tasks, projects or contexts. What I like most so far is the fact that it simply plain text editing. I can just as well open the file in my favourite text editor and hack away, I can save the file in a Dropbox folder and thus obtaining version control and backup of my valuable tasks and I can of course create various Python scripts working with the file for various reasons. A very nice bonus I discovered when I decided to move from OmniFocus to Taskpaper is that OmniFocus can export tasks directly to Taskpaper-format. I just exported everything and opened the file in Taskpaper. After a few edits I had all my tasks in the new environment and was ready to start working.\nI remembered that the last time I briefly laied my eyes on Taskpaper I had to fiddle with QuickSilver and AppleScript to get a quick way of entering tasks without bringing the Taskpaper window to focus and finding the right place to add the task to. Again I found a nice bonus. In version 2.0 of Taskpaper Jesse/HogBay added a quick entry window very similar to the ones you can find in apps such as Things, OmniFocus and the Hit List. A huge thumbs up!\nTake a look at the Taskpaper screencast and see if it is something for you. As I have changed setup several times during my last three years of GTDing I cannot say that I will stick with Taskpaper yet – it is to early. I will however give it a fair try and see how long I can “stay on the GTD wagon”.\nTip\nIf you are a notorious VIM user or work in another environment than Mac OS X, David O’Callaghan have created taskpaper.vim, a syntax file and file-plugin allowing you to comfortly edit your taskpaper files in VIM.\n","permalink":"https://buglix.org/posts/old/as-simple-as-possible/","summary":"A wise man once said that one should “Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler“, something I have seen to be true in many areas of my life recently.

In everyday situations it is just to heavy to throw in the backpack. While thinking about which camera to go with instead (an ongoing thought process of mine) it struck me that I have been a digital camera user for 10 years this year, and during this time frame bought and sold no less than 16 cameras (almost two per year). I have owned everything from the most simple VGA-resolution cameras like the Agfa ePhoto CL18 to professional models like the Canon EOS 40D with all kinds of accessories and tools.\nThe realization of changing camera almost twice a year got me thinking if I’m only in digital cameras for the chase of the next new model or why I take photos at all. My interest in photography started way back in the beginning of the nineties when I got to borrow my fathers analog Ashia Pentax Spotmatic SPII, which I still think is a very good camera. Before that I used a compact camera only for vacation and pet (our late cat Findus) snaps. When I got my hands on the Pentax and the fine lenses that came with it, I realized that photography wasn’t only a way of freezing a moment, it was a creative outlet as well. I started shooting more artistic and especially nature/landscape shots. It was always a thrill to get the film back from the camera shop and looking through the master pieces. The years went by and my interest in photography faded until almost 10 years later when my upper secondary school got a digital camera (the revolution!).\nThe camera was a Kodak DC200, a brick that produced grainy 640 by 480 pixel shots in bright light. Anything else than perfect shooting conditions and all you got was a pixel blur. That did not stop me for a second though. Even if the camera was school property, we were allowed to borrow it during evenings and weekends – a benefit I often took advantage of. Compared to shooting with the Pentax, this was like going back to my first compact, more of a memory freeze than an artistic outlet, but it was amazing to skip the whole development process and not having to pay for each shot. A year later I bought my first digital camera, a Agfa ePhoto CL18, more ore less the same kind of camera as the DC200, but I didn’t have to ask someone every time I wanted to use it.\nThe pattern I have observed while going through my list of previously owned cameras is that I’m torn between artistic expression and my love for advanced technology. All my friends know that I’m a technology loving, early adopting gearhead who is always on the hunt for the next cool gadget. During the last 10 years there have been a small revolution in digital cameras which have fuled my fire for technology by releasing new and more advanced models each year. I love to read reviews of new cameras, dig in user forums (like dpreview.com), look at 200% enlargements of ISO comparisons between different camera models and so on. Of course that has been very good for the gadgetist in me, but not always a great match for the artistic photographer. I say “not always” because some of the cameras have unleashed the same kind of creative freedom I first experienced with the Spotmatic.\nIn a couple of weeks I’m going on a trip to Japan and of course I want to take a lot of vacation snaps and also artistic images. With the realization that I’m often torn between creativity and technology (heart and brain?) I’m now hunting for a camera that I know will satisfy my artistic and creative side foremost. Right now I have a few contenders, but haven’t been able to decide yet. The Olympus E-620 seems to be a good compromise. It is an SLR, but it is very small and lightweight, especially if equipped with the Zuiko 25mm pancake lens. My main arguments for the E-620 is that it has a swiveling screen and built-in “Art Filters” (I know, it is just digital filters that is also easy to apply in post processing, but that’s thinking with the brain, not with the heart). Olympus will release another interesting camera in mid June as well. It is a micro four thirds camera in retro range finder style, something that sounds appealing to me. Another very interesting thing is something I saw on my last trip to Tokyo. It was a digital version of the Lomo camera Diana+ (see pic above). I have always been drawn to Lomo cameras, but I don’t want to hassle with analog film anymore. A digital version would be very nice. Will check it again on my next visit in June (think I saw it at the department store Tokyo Hands).\nMy next camera?\nEither way I will soon be buying a new camera. The difference this time is that I will buy with my heart instead of my brain and hopefully snap a bunch of creative images on my next trip.\nIf you want to take a look at my photos, either go to my flickr page or my page at Fotosidan.se (a Swedish photography site).

Fortunately I solely use IMAP and thus all messages are safely stored and backed up on a server somewhere. Unfortunately, for Mail.app, this was the last time I go through the agonizing pain of setting it up the way I want just to have to redo it in a couple of weeks. I don’t know if it is the amount of messages in my mail accounts or something else, but it keeps happening.\nThe first impulse was to download Thunderbird, but I have never liked it on a Mac. There is something I can’t really pinpoint … something of a bad usage feeling. I recently read on LifeHacker.com that Woz organizes all his e-mail with Eudora and so I actually considered it for a brief moment, but no, it is to much 1998 over it.\nAs I have done several times before on this matter, I turned to Google. A search for “mail clients for mac” resulted in 78,300,000 hits, most of which I have probably read before, but this time, an article caught my attention – Postbox: An Alternative Email Client For Mac | MakeUseOf.com.\nPostbox is a new kind of e-mail animal that builds on Mozilla technology and adds several interesting features like “topics” (where conversations can be tagged), integration with social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and Flickr (to mention a few), working indexing and a smashing user interface. Another feature I really like is archive. I just press ‘a’ and the selected message goes to an archive folder of my choice. Inbox zero in no time, and no need for expensive addons like Mail Act-On (for Mail.app).\nEven if this is not a open/libre program (and it probably will have a price tag later on) I’m diving in head first and don’t look back. After using the “Beta 11” version for a couple of hours I must say that I’m happy so far. A good and sleek e-mail app is a crucial part of my work day and so far Postbox seems to handle it well. I will give an update when I have used it for a while. In the meantime, download the beta and play with it yourself at http://postbox-inc.com/ (available for both Mac and Windows, no Linux version yet).\n","permalink":"https://buglix.org/posts/old/going-postal/","summary":"After your computer crashes for the second time of the day and you reboot, the last thing you want to be greeted with when starting the Mail.app is this:\nThis is not the first time Mail.app forgets who I am and where my e-mail is stored.

It took some time to get the right technique, thus avoiding razor burn and pimples, but it was worth the wait. When you get a perfect shave it feels really smooth, and lasts longer than a shave performed with a traditional electric shaver.\nEven though I’m happy with the performance of my safety razor, I wanted something more – an even smoother shave. When I first bought the safety razor I found cut throat razors (or straight razor/open razor) in the web shop and started researching this lost art form on the web. The precision and danger (it is not that dangerous, but still, they don’t call it “razor sharp” for nothing) intrigued me, and I wanted to see if it was possible to get an even smoother shave.\nAfter some time of hesitation, I finally bought an Edwin Jagger Cut Throatrazor and a Dovo strap from Gents.se. When I came home I whipped up some soap and covered the back side of my hand for a test run. It was kind of a strange feeling running this super sharp thing just millimeter(s) over the veins in the hand. It went well, but I was not ready to use it on my face just yet so I watched a lot of YouTube shaving videos last night… here is a small collection:\n A shave with a straight razor How to shave with a straight razor part 1 – equipment How to shave with a straight razor part 2 – The Shave Straight razor shave  I also read a long and interesting article (PDF) about it and finally felt that I was ready for a serious test run. So this morning I locked the bathroom door (to avoid any unnecessary stress like sudden interruptions 🙂 ) and started my first cut throat shave. It took some time to get a steady hand, but after a couple of strokes I thought it went pretty well.\nEven though I didn’t cut myself, I still have a long road before I get the same results as with the safety razor and I guess even more time to reach the nirvana of shaving, but at the same time as it is a daily habit it is also kind of a small hobby. During the shave it is almost impossible to think about other things which gives the whole process something of a zen feeling to it. Usually I just rush through my morning routine, so this can be something to build it around – a calm start of the day.\n","permalink":"https://buglix.org/posts/old/i-took-the-straight-razor-plunge/","summary":"During almost a year I have shaved using a safety razor and it has given me a closer shave than all electric shavers or plastic Mach-X-style Gilette razors I have tried so far.

My requirements for this laptop was that it should be fairly cheap (max 1000 euros), run Linux with ease and feature a 12 inch wide screen.\nAfter browsing through some local (Swedish) internet stores I soon concluded that I had to go with the high end consumer segment instead of the business segment, otherwise my budget requirement would have gone through the roof. I narrowed the selection down to either the Lenovo 3000 V100 or the FSC Amilo SI 1520. The Lenovo sported a higher build quality, but the FSC had better specs in almost any area (CPU, HDD, battery time etc). Both of them were proven to run Linux (Ubuntu and Gentoo), but the resources on the web was very limited (that is one of the reasons for me writing this article right now).\nUbuntu Installing Ubuntu 6.10 on this piece of hardware was very straightforward. I just chose to resize my Windows XP partition (want to keep it for some experimentation) to 10 GB and use the rest for Ubuntu.\nAfter the installation was completed it was just a matter of installing the 915resolution package to get the native resolution (1280 x 800) of the screen.\nThe wireless network card (Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG, kernel module ipw3945) was detected without problems, but ipw3945 and Gnome Network Manager applet 0.6.3 did not play together. It didn’t take long until I found out that 0.6.4 supports ipw3945 and is available in the development version of Ubuntu (Feisty 7.04).\nI thought it could be fun to test the latest Ubuntu (and have nice wireless controls in Gnome) so I started to upgrade my Edge to Feisty. It is a very simple procedure. Simply make sure that your system is up to date. Then run the command:\ngksudo \u0026quot;update-manager -c -d\u0026quot;\nIf it whines about authorization problems you must execute GPG as the super user (root) one time before running the update-manager. It is also very simple:\nsudo su gpg [CTRL+c] exit Then run the update-manager again.\nHardware status I have read a few articles about Linux on the Amilo SI 1520 and the only thing that seems a bit tricky is the built-in microphone. I can confirm that it does not work out of the box, but I have not tried to get it working.

Today I switched mode of the camera to capture both Raw and JPEG’s for each photo, and when I was about to transfer the images to my PC I realized that I need a good “Image Grinder” to copy the images to their locations.

It can be completely command line driven so it can be used from another script (listening on the D-Bus for USB events for instance) and simply takes a input directory and a description of the files.\nUsage:\nimagetransfer, v0.0.1 - Copyright (C) 2006 Emil Erlandsson Usage: imagetransfer.py [path] ([description] -d) Where ... * [path] is the location where the images are stored. * [description] is optional. If not given, it will be asked for via stdin. * -d is also optional. If given (last) it will remove the original files. Use with care! I’m not sure if I will evolve the original Image Grinder idea or if I will play with this script some more and add features.\nYou can download the script here:\nhttp://www.buglix.org/wp-content/uploads/imagetransfer.py and a needed utility script here:\nhttp://www.buglix.org/wp-content/uploads/namefix.py\nUpdate 2006-12-31\nYou can now get the code highlighted as well.

Today I switched mode of the camera to capture both Raw and JPEG’s for each photo, and when I was about to transfer the images to my PC I realized that I need a good “Image Grinder” to copy the images to their locations.","title":"Image Grinder Light"},{"content":"During my vacation I have re-organized my digital photo collection.

I decided to test it out by writing a plugin for displaying the current playing song in Rhythmbox in instant messages when the keyword ‘%rb’ is found (I know there is a plugin for that already, but I did not get that to work).\nThe first step was to download the small source for the Perl API example from the Gaim site and try to get it to work. I placed the script in ~/.gaim/plugins, but sadly it did not load when I started Gaim. Time to start to debug the supposed-to-work-sample-code … how I love that.\nThe first thing that hits you when you are starting to read the debug messages from a Gaim session is that many of them are a bit strange, like these two:\ndns[30097]: Oops, father has gone, wait for me, wait...! dns[742]: nobody needs me... =(\nAfter firering up Gaim with the -d flag I started to realize that the version of Gaim I was using was not compiled with the Perl extension. Or actually, the Ubuntu package I use does not include it (I probably will check out why later on and submit a bug because I think it should be there).\nFortunately it was pretty straight forward to build the Perl extension by hand and just moving to /usr/lib/gaim without disturbing anything else in my system.\nSo when the Perl extension was available and Gaim.pm was ready in @INC I could finally load the sample script into Gaim. I thought this was going to be easy. I had already prepared the script that reads information from Rhythmbox by executing the command line interface with different flags. How hard could it be to just plug that in when a message was sent? Pretty hard I tell you 🙂\nI understod from the API that I could connect my callback functions to different signals, but I could not find any complete listing of these signals. I finally found this test file signals-test.c in the Gaim source tree containing test calls for all the supported signals. From there I got a fairly good idea of how the signals was implemented in C and which signal I should use (sending-im-msg).\nThe next headache was this anoying little message in the debug log of Gaim:\nsignals: Signal data for sending-im-msg not found.\nThe code snippet below is the one generating this irritating message. All the examples (which are few) of how to use the Gaim::signal_connect function passes in either an empty variable or undef as the last “data” parameter.\nGaim::signal_connect( Gaim::Conversations::handle, \u0026#34;sending-im-msg\u0026#34;, $plugin, \\\u0026amp;signal_sending_im_cb, undef); However, the sending-signals requires this variable to be a Perl hash. This took some time to figure out. I had to go to the Gaim plugin repository at Sourceforge.net and find another Perl plugin to compare with. So after changing “undef” to %data (which is some undefined variable by the way) it all worked out nicely.\nAfter entering the magic string %rb in a Gaim IM conversation, my counterpart got these magic words:\nEmil is playing “Nutshell” by Alice in Chains from Unplugged at 2:22(5:00).\nThe conclusion from this small coding adventure is that the API for writing Perl plugins for Gaim is fairly weak. The introduction tuturial is quite good, but lacks certain details. If I get some time over sometime I could perhaps help out with that.\nIf you would like to see the result, you can get it here (or see it syntax highlighted by VIM here).\n","permalink":"https://buglix.org/posts/old/gaim-plugin-development-in-ubuntu/","summary":"I recently remembered that Gaim has a nice Perl API for writing plugins (or actually I was rembembered by a friend).

When developing products, the developer is frequently faced with the problem to deal with binary files in some way or the other. The reasons for having to deal with binary data formats today are many, and could for example be viewing of scientific data files, looking into image formats for specific headers, “debugging” of the output from some tool or simply having to deal with legacy data formats.\nTo solve these problems, Purple Scout offers a solution divided into two parts. The first part is a Java Library for usage in existing applications. It takes XML specifications of file formats as input and while parsing the binary file it builds an Abstract File Tree (AFT) containing all the information in a more processing friendly format. The AFT could then be used to generate reports via XSLT style-sheets, or via visualization which takes us into the second part of the solution – the Eclipse based viewer.\nHexadecimal Editor BinOcular - HexviewBinOcular is built as a set of Eclipse Plugins. The most basic part is the Multipart Editor which defines the common view of an binary editor (or reader if you will – “editor” is the Eclipse name of a component dealing with viewing and editing files). It defines two basic views: a hexadecimal view – where frequent hex editor users will feel right at home – and a tree view visualizing the AFT. The hexadecimal view lets the library express the binary file in its most raw form. The tree view showing the AFT gives the user an opportunity to easily get an overview of the file. BinOcular has support for something called “Specific editors”. They extend the plugin, by adding more views specific to a binary format. For instance, if you are working with image files, you might want an area where you can browse the actual image as well as all the meta information for the file.\n","permalink":"https://buglix.org/posts/old/binocular-bits-in-structure/","summary":"I would like to take the oppertunity to talk a little about our latest project at Purple Scout.\nBinOcular - Tabs featureBinOcular is the response to an ever-growing need to browse different kinds of binary files, both modern well documented formats, as well as obscure legacy ones.
