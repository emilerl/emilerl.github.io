  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
six months that they need for digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing. 
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sticker-mule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing Number One&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
drawing frightened them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
hat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog — at least I had him for a few days until he ran away — and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college — one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “Yale News.”— and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The number of applications in Apple’s App Store has exploded during 2009 and it is getting harder and harder to find new stuff. Therefore I thought it was a good idea to share my favorite applications of 2009 (mostly based on the apps I have used the most).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://erlandsson.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/photo-full.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://erlandsson.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/photo-thumb4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reederapp.com/&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a &lt;a href=&quot;http://reader.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; addict I have tried several iPhone apps for accessing my feeds while on the road. First I used the mobile version of Google Reader, simply browsing to the site in Safari. It didn’t map to the way I use reader though and later I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phantomfish.com/byline.html&quot;&gt;Byline&lt;/a&gt; (native app) which was a step in the right direction. After that I started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWireiPhone/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt; which also improved the reading experience. It wasn’t until I found Reeder that I can say I’m happy with the reading experience on the iPhone. There are only a few features that I miss (such as reading items shared by others, or recommended items). One of the apps I use most days except Mail and Phone.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com/iphone&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Instapaper is a good complement to Google Reader and other news services allowing me to read some of the longer articles when I have the time. Besides my Sony Reader Touch (via Calibre), the iPhone app is the place were I read most of the content from Instapaper.com.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/&quot;&gt;Tweetie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My Twitter usage goes up and down, but when I’m in the mood, I use Tweetie on the iPhone.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boxcar.io/&quot;&gt;Boxcar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A good complement to Tweetie, allowing me to get notifications about direct messages or mentions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hipstamaticapp.com/&quot;&gt;Hipstamatic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Of all the camera apps I have tried, this is the only one I have kept. The various lenses and films you can buy in the application makes you want to experiment and try new things. For some examples, check &lt;a href=&quot;http://emilerl.posterous.com/paper-stuff&quot;&gt;“Paper Stuff”&lt;/a&gt; at my Posterous blog.  &lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/ninjawords&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; (via: Daring Fireball) around Ninjawords was actually the thing that got me to try it. As the web service (&lt;a href=&quot;http://ninjawords.com&quot;&gt;ninjawords.com&lt;/a&gt;) it is a really fast way of looking up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiktionary.org/&quot;&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt; words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoofien.com/Snatch/index.html&quot;&gt;Snatch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the summer of 09 I bought a Mac Mini and installed Plex. I didn’t want a complete keyboad and mouse setup, so instead I researched remote control solutions allowing me to remote control the Mini via my iPhone and WiFi (or BlueTooth). Even though it is a bit unstable from time to time, it is still my favorite way of controlling the Mini from the phone.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripit.com/uhp/iphone&quot;&gt;The TripIt App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since I travel quite a lot, the TripIt app have saved me many times during sprints at airport trying to find out when the connecting flight departs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futureacoustic.com/soundcurtain/&quot;&gt;Soundcurtain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While traveling it can be hard to find solitude and privacy to get some work done. Soundcurtain is a great cure, analyzing the environment sound volume via the mic and generates a sound to tune it out. I mostly use the rain mode.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/&quot;&gt;Nike + iPod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even though this is a built-in application I thought it was worth mentioning. If you have the Nike+ equipment it is a very nice way of keeping track of your exercise.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drinksapp.com/&quot;&gt;Top shelf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Previously named “Drinks”, Top shelf is my first stop for finding drink recipes and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamieoliver.com/20-minute-meals/&quot;&gt;20 minute meals - Jamie Oliver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another great stop for recipes. Nice inspiring photos and very clear instructions. I particularly like the shopping list feature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=342699962&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Rat on a scooter XL&lt;/a&gt; [iTunes direct link]&lt;br /&gt;
Most addictive game of 2009. I have a high score of 140 and it starts to get hard beating it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307727765&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;DoodleJump&lt;/a&gt; [iTunes direct link]&lt;br /&gt;
Second most addictive game of 2009. It does not have the same feeling of speed as Rat on a scooter, but it is still a good game. My highscore is 20.000-something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/sydsvenskan/id294010168?mt=8&quot;&gt;Sydsvenskan&lt;/a&gt; [iTunes direct link]&lt;br /&gt;
My local newspaper. The app feels solid and always brings me the latest news. One of the better news outlets in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/mobilblogg/id347854404?mt=8&quot;&gt;MobilBlogg&lt;/a&gt; [iTunes direct link]&lt;br /&gt;
A friend and a colleague at &lt;a href=&quot;http://purplescout.se&quot;&gt;Purple Scout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tobi.nu/&quot;&gt;Tobias/tru&lt;/a&gt; have created a very nice client for the Swedish micro blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobilblogg.nu&quot;&gt;mobilblogg.nu&lt;/a&gt; (requires account). Even though I don’t use mobilblogg.nu that much, I thought it was worth mentioning since it is a very nice and solid application. It is released as &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.purplescout.se/projects/show/mbiphone&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stardefense.ngmoco.com/&quot;&gt;StarDefence&lt;/a&gt;
Before this game I wasn’t that much into tower defense games, but it has all changed now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firemint.com/flightcontrol/&quot;&gt;FlightControl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Addicive fun, especially to play against another player via BlueTooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently sold my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Nikon/nikon_d90.asp&quot;&gt;Nikon D90&lt;/a&gt; since I realized that I only use an SLR-camera when I’m on vacation. In everyday situations it is just to heavy to throw in the backpack. While thinking about which camera to go with instead (an ongoing thought process of mine) it struck me that I have been a digital camera user for 10 years this year, and during this time frame bought and sold no less than 16 cameras (almost two per year). I have owned everything from the most simple VGA-resolution cameras like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Agfa/agfa_cl18.asp&quot;&gt;Agfa ePhoto CL18&lt;/a&gt; to professional models like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_eos40d.asp&quot;&gt;Canon EOS 40D&lt;/a&gt; with all kinds of accessories and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization of changing camera almost twice a year got me thinking if I’m only in digital cameras for the chase of the next new model or why I take photos at all. My interest in photography started way back in the beginning of the nineties when I got to borrow my fathers analog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/index-frameset.html?AsahiPentaxSpotmaticSPII.html~mainFrame&quot;&gt;Ashia Pentax Spotmatic SPI&lt;/a&gt;I, which I still think is a very good camera. Before that I used a compact camera only for vacation and pet (our late cat Findus) snaps. When I got my hands on the Pentax and the fine lenses that came with it, I realized that photography wasn’t only a way of freezing a moment, it was a creative outlet as well. I started shooting more artistic and especially nature/landscape shots. It was always a thrill to get the film back from the camera shop and looking through the master pieces. The years went by and my interest in photography faded until almost 10 years later when my upper secondary school got a digital camera (the revolution!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/index-frameset.html?AsahiPentaxSpotmaticSPII.html~mainFrame&quot;&gt;Kodak DC200&lt;/a&gt;, a brick that produced grainy 640 by 480 pixel shots in bright light. Anything else than perfect shooting conditions and all you got was a pixel blur. That did not stop me for a second though. Even if the camera was school property, we were allowed to borrow it during evenings and weekends - a benefit I often took advantage of. Compared to shooting with the Pentax, this was like going back to my first compact, more of a memory freeze than an artistic outlet, but it was amazing to skip the whole development process and not having to pay for each shot. A year later I bought my first digital camera, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Agfa/agfa_cl18.asp&quot;&gt;Agfa ePhoto CL18&lt;/a&gt;, more ore less the same kind of camera as the DC200, but I didn’t have to ask someone every time I wanted to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern I have observed while going through my list of previously owned cameras is that I’m torn between artistic expression and my love for advanced technology. All my friends know that I’m a technology loving, early adopting gearhead who is always on the hunt for the next cool gadget. During the last 10 years there have been a small revolution in digital cameras which have fuled my fire for technology by releasing new and more advanced models each year. I love to read reviews of new cameras, dig in user forums (like dpreview.com), look at 200% enlargements of ISO comparisons between different camera models and so on. Of course that has been very good for the gadgetist in me, but not always a great match for the artistic photographer. I say “not always” because some of the cameras have unleashed the same kind of creative freedom I first experienced with the Spotmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of weeks I’m going on a trip to Japan and of course I want to take a lot of vacation snaps and also artistic images. With the realization that I’m often torn between creativity and technology (heart and brain?) I’m now hunting for a camera that I know will satisfy my artistic and creative side foremost. Right now I have a few contenders, but haven’t been able to decide yet. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/news/0902/09022401olympuse620.asp&quot;&gt;Olympus E-620&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a good compromise. It is an SLR, but it is very small and lightweight, especially if equipped with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cameralabs.com/reviews/Olympus_Zuiko_Digital_25mm_pancake/&quot;&gt;Zuiko 25mm pancake lens&lt;/a&gt;. My main arguments for the E-620 is that it has a swiveling screen and built-in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/product.asp?product=1452&quot;&gt;“Art Filters”&lt;/a&gt; (I know, it is just digital filters that is also easy to apply in post processing, but that’s thinking with the brain, not with the heart). Olympus will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/news/0809/08092208olympus_micro_four_thirds.asp&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; another interesting camera in mid June as well. It is a micro four thirds camera in retro range finder style, something that sounds appealing to me. Another very interesting thing is something I saw on my last trip to Tokyo. It was a digital version of the Lomo camera &lt;a href=&quot;http://microsites.lomography.com/diana/&quot;&gt;Diana+&lt;/a&gt; (see pic above). I have always been drawn to Lomo cameras, but I don’t want to hassle with analog film anymore. A digital version would be very nice. Will check it again on my next visit in June (think I saw it at the department store &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tokyu-hands.co.jp/&quot;&gt;Tokyo Hands&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpreview.com/news/0902/09022401olympuse620.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://erlandsson.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/olympus-e-620_1.jpg?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;Olympus E-620&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way I will soon be buying a new camera. The difference this time is that I will buy with my heart instead of my brain and hopefully snap a bunch of creative images on my next trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to take a look at my photos, either go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilerl&quot;&gt;my flickr page&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fotosidan.se/member/view.htm?ID=3932&quot;&gt; my page at Fotosidan.se&lt;/a&gt; (a Swedish photography site). Of course I can give advice on the cameras I have previously owned if you are thinking of buying one, just send an e-mail (check the About page for info).&lt;/p&gt;
